So hai.  
My name is Morten Linderud. I am 18 years and currently living in Bergen.  
I love programming and currently know Python, and learning Clojure (giant leap, i know). Been messing with Java, SML, C#, C/C++, and bunch of other languages before, so got a general knowledge about a bunch of stuff.

My personal goal is too start university as soon as possible, and aim for a Master in Computer Science.

This blog will be me rambling about anything i find interesting. From opinions about different topics, things that interest me and programming (and more programming).

The blog itself is currently written in Python. I will attempt rewriting it inn Clojure when i have gotten that far. I will also write a post about the current implementations of the blog, and all the bad code which is written to make it work.

So i hope you enjoy this rambling sudo philosopcial bullsh*t i wanna call a blog.
